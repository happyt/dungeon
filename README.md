# dungeon v.0.02

## Quick start

This was an app created to explore a hack evening idea of a dungeon maze. It's very simple, unfinished and just has simple N,S,E,W commands to move around rooms. 

* uses an early version of readline, later versions may not have the same facilities
* v0.0.2 added the package.json for easy install

To run this app

* Install node.js  (which will install npm)
* 'npm install'
* Run 'node cmd.js'
